###Configuring Your Docker Client 
###To configure your Docker client, carry out the following steps 

###Add the following to your DNS or to the client's /etc/hosts file: 

<ip-address> art.local 

###Since the certificate is self-signed, you need to import it to your Docker certificate trust store as described in the  Docker documentation. 
###Alternatively, you can configure the Docker client to work with an insecure registry by adding the following line to your /etc/default/docker file 
###(you may need to create the file if it does not already exist):

DOCKER_OPTS="$DOCKER_OPTS --insecure-registry art.local:5001"

###Restart your Docker engine.

###Test Your Setup
###To verify your reverse proxy is configured correctly, run the following command:

###Make sure the following results in return code 200
curl -I -k -v https://<artifactory url>/api/system/ping

###Now you can proceed to test your Docker registry.

###Login to Artifactory as your Docker registry

docker login -u admin -p password 10.1.16.114:8082
###Pull the hello-world image from the docker-virtual repository

docker pull 10.1.16.114:8082/docker-virtual/hello-world:latest
###Tag a Docker image

docker tag 10.1.16.114:8082/docker-virtual/hello-world:latest 10.1.16.114:8082/docker-virtual/<tag_name>
###Push the tagged image to docker-virtual

docker push 10.1.16.114:8082/docker-virtual/<tag_name>
